Pipe Popper is a simple, relaxing puzzle game.

Tap to select a connected network of pipes, then tap the network again to pop them away. 
Larger pipe networks create larger point bonuses!

But be careful to avoid creating dead zones.

The game ends when you have no more possible pipe networks.

How high can you get your score before that happens?

- Works offline!
- Ad-free!
- No time limit means no stress!
